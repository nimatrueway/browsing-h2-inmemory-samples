In [a short article](http://nimatrueway.github.io/2017/03/01/h2-inmem-browsing.html) I explained how we browse h2-inmemory database with an external database-browser in the middle of an integration test.

These are the two sample projects implementing that, one is written in Scala (stack of play-slick-mcwire) and the other one is written in Java (stack of springboot-flyway).
